## Local data

This directory contains local data files that are not tracked by version control. These files may include sensitive information or large datasets that should not be shared publicly.

To manage these files, we use a `.gitignore` file to exclude them from being committed to the repository. Please ensure that any new data files added to this directory are also listed in the `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits.

This way we have a really clean list of the file formats we are using in this directory.
Please refer to the `.gitignore` file in this directory for more details on which files are excluded.
